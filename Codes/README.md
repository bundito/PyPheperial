## Overview
This directory is for codes, just like it says it in the name.
I am currently revising my codes in order to make them neat and tidy. Otherwise, the codes would be spaghetti codes. 

All the functions and features could be seen in each README.md files.

## Informations

 - Wrappers Directory.
Everything related to SDK to Python porting should be updated there. 

- main.py
This is the main Python Script that would be needed to run the project. I would post some examples later I finish some more of low-level based work.
